# Vehicle-Detection-Classification-and-Number-Plate-Text-Extraction---Image-Processing-

PROBLEM STATEMENT
Our project primarily focuses on 3 main aspects : 
i) Convert a on-ground traffic video into its constituent frames and extract vehicles from each frame. 
ii) Classify the extracted vehicles into various categories (like car, bus, motorcycle etc.)
ii )Extract number plate text from detected vehicles.


LEARNING OBJECTIVE
1.Detect vehicles from a video and extract them using image enhancement, contouring, smoothening etc.
2. Categorize the extracted image using a trained  Machine learning model .
3. Highlight the number plate from an image of a vehicle. This includes finding contours and applying arithmetic operations to the image. For extracting text, we used pytesseract.
4. To analyze our solution to the problem and determine the scope of the project. Discuss applications and future scope.
